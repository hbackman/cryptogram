# Cryptogram

A decentralized microblogging platform on blockchain.

## Overview

Cryptogram (TBD) is a distributed microblogging service built on a custom blockchain.
Each post is stored as a transaction on the blockchain, ensuring immutability,
censorship resistance, and decentralization. Nodes participate in the network
to store and validate posts, using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network for communication.
